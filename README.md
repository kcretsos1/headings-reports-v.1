# headings-reports-v.1
These pages generate reports for first time names and subject headings in the library catalog. By default, the pages are set to search from week to week, however, you can set them up by other time intervals (for example from month to month). If you copy the headings into notepad and save the file, you can upload a batch search for headings in OCLC's Connexion software.
